# Croquis-Collector
Download all model poses from Croquis Cafe (figure drawing photo reference site - http://www.onairvideo.com/photo-archive.html).

This python script creates folders in the directory it runs from for each model and fills the folder with the model's poses. If a folder with the model's name exists it will skip the download of that set of photos.
