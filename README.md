# Croquis-Collector
Downloads all model poses from Croquis Cafe, a figure drawing reference site - http://www.onairvideo.com/photo-archive.html.

This Python 3.7 script will create a subdirectory per model in the directory it is run in and fills the folder with the model's pose photos. If a folder with the model's name already exists it will skip that model. At time of writing - 23/01/19 - the Croquis Cafe photo collection is 3.1 GB large, comprised of 3874 jpgs of 83 models.

Requires requests and beautifulsoup4 modules.
