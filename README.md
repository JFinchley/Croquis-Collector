# Croquis-Collector
Download all model poses from Croquis Cafe, a figure drawing reference site - http://www.onairvideo.com/photo-archive.html.

This python script creates folders in the directory it runs from for each model and fills the folder with the model's poses. If a folder with the model's name exists it will skip the download of that set of photos. At time of writing (23/01/19), this is 3.1 GB comprised of 3874 jpgs total in 83 directories.

Requires requests and beautifulsoup4 modules.
